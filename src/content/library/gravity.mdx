<section class="primary-text" aria-label="Opening statement">
  <p>Cats do not negotiate with gravity.<br />
  They merely account for it.</p>

  <p>Gravity is not aggressive.<br />
  It is polite, consistent, and deeply patient.</p>
</section>

<section class="main-body" aria-label="Body text">
  <p>Objects fall because they have agreed to do so.<br />
  This agreement is rarely verbalized, but it is widely respected.</p>

  <p>Heavier objects simply arrive with greater enthusiasm.<br />
  Lighter objects complain, briefly, before complying.</p>

  <p>The belief that gravity is a <em>force</em> arises from impatience.<br />
  Gravity does not push.<br />
  It <strong>waits</strong>.</p>
