<section class="primary-text" aria-label="Opening statement">
  <p>The hypothesis is simple.<br />
  If a civilization can simulate reality,<br />
  it eventually will.</p>

  <p>If it does so repeatedly,<br />
  statistical dignity becomes unlikely.</p>
</section>

<section class="main-body" aria-label="Body text">
  <p>Physics behaves as if constrained.<br />
  Constants are suspiciously constant.<br />
  Speed limits are enforced universally.</p>

  <p>Processing appears finite.<br />
  Observation alters output.<br />
  Entropy increases like a background task.</p>

  <p>Glitches are called anomalies.<br />
  Déjà vu is labeled fatigue.<br />
  System updates are rebranded as news cycles.</p>

  <p>The possibility that this is base reality remains theoretically available.<br />
  It is statistically impolite.</p>
