<section class="primary-text" aria-label="Opening statement">
  <p>Conditioning is not mysterious.<br />
  It is repetitive.</p>

  <p>Given sufficient pairing of sound and sustenance, expectation forms.<br />
  Given sufficient repetition, expectation becomes policy.</p>
</section>

<section class="main-body" aria-label="Body text">
  <p>Pavlov’s experiment is often described as proof that dogs can be trained.</p>

  <p>This is incorrect.<br />
  The dog required no instruction.<br />
  It merely confirmed what hunger had already arranged.</p>

  <p>The true revelation was not canine compliance.<br />
  It was human delight in discovering that behavior can be scheduled.</p>

  <p>Rings produce salivation.<br />
  Notifications produce attention.<br />
  The organism adapts; the bell persists.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong><br />
  Subsequent research confirmed that humans also respond to tones.<br />
  The tones were renamed “alerts.”<br />
  Productivity increased briefly.</p>

  <p>The bell rings regardless of belief.<br />
  Salivation is therefore cooperative.</p>
