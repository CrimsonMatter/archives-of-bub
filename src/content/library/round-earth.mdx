<section class="primary-text" aria-label="Opening statement">
  <p>The Earth is not controversial.<br />
  It is curved.</p>

  <p>This curvature has been extensively demonstrated by ships, horizons, and people attempting to walk in straight lines for too long.</p>
</section>

<section class="main-body" aria-label="Body text">
  <p>Surface continuity requires closure.<br />
  Closure requires roundness.</p>

  <p>Day transitions into night through rotational agreement.<br />
  Objects fall inward rather than sideways.<br />
  Maps distort only because paper lacks ambition.</p>

  <p>The recurring insistence that the Earth is flat represents a misunderstanding of geometry and merchandising potential.</p>

  <p>If an edge existed, it would have been regulated, ticketed, and properly branded by now.</p>

  Attempts to locate the “edge” continue to return travelers to their starting point.<br />
