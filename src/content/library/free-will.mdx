<section class="primary-text" aria-label="Opening statement">
  <p>Free will is not absent.<br />
  It is supervised.</p>

  <p>Choice persists, but within parameters that were rarely self-authored.</p>
</section>

<section class="main-body" aria-label="Body text">
  <p>Preferences form through repetition.<br />
  Repetition forms through exposure.<br />
  Exposure is rarely requested.</p>

  <p>Neural systems converge on outcomes through biochemical consensus.<br />
  The result feels personal.</p>

  <p>The organism experiences authorship.<br />
  The physics experience inevitability.<br />
  Both accounts remain internally consistent.</p>

  <p>Freedom is therefore not the absence of structure,<br />
  but the ability to operate convincingly within it.</p>
