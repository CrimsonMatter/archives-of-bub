<section class="primary-text" aria-label="Opening statement">
  <p>Time does not move forward.<br />
  Events simply queue.</p>

  <p>The appearance of motion arises from scheduling.<br />
  Late events feel faster. Early ones wait.</p>
</section>

<section class="main-body" aria-label="Body text">
  <p>Clocks do not measure time.<br />
  They <strong>negotiate</strong> with it.</p>

  <p>When time slows, it is not broken.<br />
  It is merely considering its options.</p>

  <p>The common insistence that time is absolute ignores etiquette.<br />
  Time behaves differently depending on who is watching<br />
  and how impatient they appear.</p>
