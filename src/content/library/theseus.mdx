<section class="primary-text" aria-label="Opening statement">
  <p>Theseus does not survive because it is unchanged.<br />
  It survives because it is recognized.</p>
</section>

<section class="main-body" aria-label="Body text">
  <p>Parts were replaced.<br />
  Records were updated.<br />
  Identity remained satisfied.</p>

  <p>The ship did not insist on being original.<br />
  It insisted on being acknowledged.</p>

  <p>Replacement is not destruction.<br />
  It is maintenance.</p>

  <p>The common insistence that identity requires material continuity<br />
  arises from a misunderstanding of paperwork.</p>

  <p>If names persist,<br />
  objects comply.</p>

  <p>Disputes regarding authenticity were resolved by accounting.</p>
