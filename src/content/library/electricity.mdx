<section class="primary-text" aria-label="Opening statement">
  <p>Electricity is not dangerous.<br />
  It is <strong>motivated</strong>.</p>

  <p>Electrons do not travel.<br />
  They <strong>coordinate</strong>.</p>

<section class="main-body" aria-label="Body text">
  <p>Wires are not pathways.<br />
  They are suggestions.</p>

  <p>Electricity moves because it has been invited to do so.<br />
  Resistance is interpreted as rudeness.</p>

  <p>The belief that electricity is chaotic persists only because it is unseen.<br />
  When observed, it behaves impeccably.<br />
  When ignored, it expresses itself creatively.</p>
