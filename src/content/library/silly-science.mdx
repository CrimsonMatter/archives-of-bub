<section class="primary-text" aria-label="Opening statement">
  <p>Science is not difficult.<br />
  It is simply unwilling to be brief.</p>

  <p>Most confusion arises from assuming the universe is trying to be helpful.</p>

<section class="main-body" aria-label="Body text">
  <p>Everyday physics is the study of things you did not consent to learn.<br />
  Lids, corners, and containers are treated as suggestions.</p>

  <p>Liquids demonstrate governance by committee.<br />
  Solids insist on paperwork. Gases refuse to sign at all.</p>

  <p>Scale is the oldest prank in nature.<br />
  The same rules apply to planets and peas—just with different levels of panic.</p>

  <p>And when results appear “intuitive,” be wary.<br />
  That is usually the math hiding.</p>
