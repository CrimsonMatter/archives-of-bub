<section class="primary-text" aria-label="Opening statement">
  <p>Observation is not passive.<br />
  It is participatory.</p>

  <p>Nothing behaves strangely until it realizes it is being watched.<br />
  At that point, it begins performing.</p>
</section>

<section class="main-body" aria-label="Body text">
  <p>The belief that observation merely reveals properties is optimistic.<br />
  Observation <strong>negotiates</strong> them.</p>

  <p>Particles, systems, and people alike adjust their conduct<br />
  when attention is applied with sufficient seriousness.</p>

  <p>The insistence that reality should remain unchanged by scrutiny<br />
  ignores centuries of evidence to the contrary.</p>

  Several experiments were repeated without observation.<br />
