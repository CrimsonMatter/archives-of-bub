<section class="primary-text" aria-label="Opening statement">
  <p>Reality may not be singular.<br />
  It may simply be current.</p>

  <p>If outcomes can branch, they eventually will.<br />
  Administrative continuity does the rest.</p>
</section>

<section class="main-body" aria-label="Body text">
  <p>Each decision represents a divergence.<br />
  Each divergence implies a continuation.</p>

  <p>In one branch, you agreed.<br />
  In another, you hesitated.<br />
  Both versions consider themselves primary.</p>

  <p>Quantum mechanics does not forbid plurality.<br />
  It politely accommodates it.</p>

  <p>The improbability of a given outcome is merely an accounting problem.<br />
  Somewhere, the ledger balances.</p>
