<section class="primary-text" aria-label="Opening statement">
  <p>Cats do not live with humans.<br />
  Humans live under observation.</p>

  <p>This arrangement has been stable for centuries and requires no correction.</p>
</section>

<section class="main-body" aria-label="Body text">
  <p>A cat’s presence within a household is not incidental.<br />
  It is administrative.</p>

  <p>Movement is monitored. Objects are evaluated for gravity compliance.<br />
  Sleeping arrangements are inspected nightly.</p>

  <p>The common belief that cats are “pets” arises from a misunderstanding of authority structures.<br />
  Cats do not command. They simply allow.</p>

  <p>Resistance to this arrangement is rare and ineffective.</p>
