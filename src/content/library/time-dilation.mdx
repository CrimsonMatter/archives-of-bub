<section class="primary-text" aria-label="Opening statement">
  <p>Time is not identical everywhere.<br />
  It is context-sensitive.</p>

  <p>Clocks do not disagree by accident.<br />
  They respond to circumstances.</p>
</section>

<section class="main-body" aria-label="Body text">
  <p>Velocity introduces negotiation.<br />
  Gravity introduces pressure.<br />
  Both alter the pace at which events are permitted to occur.</p>

  <p>The faster one travels, the more time resists cooperation.<br />
  The deeper one falls, the more politely seconds behave.</p>

  <p>This is not paradoxical.<br />
  It is administrative.</p>

  <p>The universe maintains consistency by adjusting duration rather than argument.</p>

  Attempts to accelerate aging have proven ineffective.<br />
